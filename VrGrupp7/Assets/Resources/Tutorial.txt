On the screen to the left you will get an order for a specific potion.
The potion does not have to be exactly the potency specified.
To create potions you will need to extract gems from stones.
Extract the gems by using the hammer and blowtorch. Then using the mortar and pestle to crush the gems.
Add the dust to a bottle. Then put some water in it. You can get water at the table in the far right corner.
Now shake the bottle to mix it.
Use the scanner on the table to see the contents of a potion.
